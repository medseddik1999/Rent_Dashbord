# Rent Price and Property Dashboard        url: https://yw93hx-midou-seddik.shinyapps.io/project/ 

This project is built using **R Shiny**, a powerful framework for creating interactive web applications directly from R. It demonstrates the use of R Shiny and its development tools to build a professional and interactive property dashboard.

## Introduction

With **R Shiny**, developers can create responsive dashboards that allow users to interactively explore data. This dashboard provides insights into rental prices, property availability, internet accessibility, and furnishing details for various cities in the Netherlands. Users can filter data at both the **Country Level** and **City Level**, exploring rental trends, property types, and related statistics.

## How to Use the Dashboard

### 1. Overview Panels

![Overview Metrics](path/to/images/overview_metrics.png)

At the top of the dashboard, you will see three key metrics: - **Average Rent Price** (in Euros) - **Total Number of Properties** listed - **Average Rent per square meter (mÂ²)**

These metrics provide a quick snapshot of the country's or city's real estate market.

### 2. Country-Level Overview
